How to use this library ?
-------------

Create a text file containing your ACII frames as in "aqua.txt"

Place your file in the "anim/" folder

In the "main.cpp" file, call the "demo" function this way "demo("anim/your_file.txt", time_stamp_value);"

The "time_stamp_value" represent the time between each frame of your animation (think so...please refer to the "Comments and Complaints" section)
